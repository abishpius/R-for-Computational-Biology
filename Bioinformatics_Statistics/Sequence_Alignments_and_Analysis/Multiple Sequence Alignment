# Multiple Sequence Alignments


A Multiple Sequence Alignment, or MSA, is exactly what it sounds like â€“ an alignment of many (more than two) sequences.
  While we could use pairwiseAlignment from Biostrings to align multiple sequences individually to our subject, this is not efficient nor as accurate as using a "true" MSA algorithm such as CLUSTALW.
```{r}
BiocManager::install("msa")
```
```{r}
library(msa)
```


```{r}
coxAA <- readAAStringSet("cox1multi.fasta")

prokDNA <- readDNAStringSet("prok.fasta")
```

This aligns the cox1 protein sequences using CLUSTALW and the default alignment parameters
```{r}
coxAligned <- msa(coxAA)
```


```{r}
prokAligned <- msa(prokDNA)
```

```{r}
print(prokAligned, show="complete")
```
Naturally there are many options available for creating multiple sequence alignments.
For example, we can choose which algorithm to align the sequences with:
msa(prokDNA, "ClustalW")
msa(prokDNA, "ClustalOmega")
msa(prokDNA, "Muscle")

```{r}
msa(coxAA,
cluster="upgma")
```

save the prokaryote sequence alignment as a stringset
```{r}
prokAlignStr = as(prokAligned, "DNAStringSet")
```

Need as DNAStringSet to write out FASTA file
```{r}
writeXStringSet(prokAlignStr, file="prokAligned.fasta")
```

Export AA alignment
```{r}
coxAlignStr = as(coxAligned, "AAStringSet")
writeXStringSet(coxAlignStr, file="coxAligned.fasta")
```

```{r}
write.phylip(coxAligned, "coxAligned.phylip")
```
