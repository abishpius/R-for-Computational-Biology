# Basic DNA Analysis


The FASTA format is very simple – it is a plain text file where the first line begins with ">" (the
description line) and contains whatever name or identifier belongs to the sequence.

The following line(s) are the sequence itself, DNA or Protein, in standard IUPAC code.

If the FASTA file contains more than one sequence, the next sequence is indicated by a new
description line – this can be repeated for as many sequences as are desired.

Let’s start by reading a FASTA file in to R using the seqinr library.

Add your top comments line and then add this line as the first actual code line: library(seqinr).

```{r}
library(seqinr)
```

Now that we have told R we are going to use the seqinr library, we can write a small piece of code to load a FASTA file.


```{r}
cox1 <- read.fasta(file="cox1.fasta", seqtype = "AA")
```

We can split the four sequences into individual sequences as well.
```{r}
length(cox1)
#cox1[1]
```

Before we go much further, let’s learn how to import a sequence directly from a database rather than from a local file.
```{r}
library(ape)
```

Note that there are many different packages that let us connect to databases – APE is just one of the easier ones.
```{r}
AB003468 <- ape::read.GenBank("AB003468", as.character = "TRUE")
```

Opening the variable by clicking the arrow to the left of its name will show you the attributes – it’s a cloning vector. 

This file is currently in binary format we need to save it as FASTA and read it in before we can do any stats.

```{r}
ape::write.dna(AB003468, file ="AB003468.fasta", format = "fasta", append = FALSE, nbcol = 6, colsep = " ", colw = 10)
```

We can also retrieve sequences from Genbank using a package created by NCBI called
rentrez

```{r}
library(rentrez)
```

The rentrez package lets us retrieve sequences in other ways than just by accession number and it doesn’t limit us to the binary format that APE does.

For example, you can search for sequences using entrez_search:

```{r}
entrez_search(db="nucleotide", term="human superoxide dismutase")
```
